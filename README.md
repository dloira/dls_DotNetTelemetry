# dls_DotNetTelemetry

Here, you could find an approach to face the observability patterns for a dotnet application ecosystem. The idea behind is to allow the teams for troubleshooting and helping with the question, “Why and when is this happening?”. 

OpenTelemetry has become the industry standard and it will be the mechanism by which application code is instrumented in the way to emit signals such as traces, metrics, and logs. An application will be properly instrumented when it will not need to add anything else to troubleshoot an issue.

The repository is still work in progress!!
